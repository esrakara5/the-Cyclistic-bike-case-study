## Scenario
You work as a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. The director of marketing emphasizes the company's growth through maximizing annual memberships. Your team's objective is to analyze the differences in bike usage between casual riders and annual members at Cyclistic. Using these insights, you will develop a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Before proceeding, your recommendations must gain approval from Cyclistic executives, supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
#### About Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share program that has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles, geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time. Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. This approach has been supported by flexible pricing plans including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers purchasing single-ride or full-day passes are categorized as casual riders, while those opting for annual memberships become Cyclistic members.
